# Cisco Spark API for Node.js

This is forked from [joelee/ciscospark](https://github.com/joelee/ciscospark). 

I did it because i need to fix [a wrong POST request made by CiscoSpark class](https://github.com/joelee/ciscospark/issues/4).

In order to make npm installation easier i've changed package.json to build the project without test.

For more information about the package please [visite](https://github.com/joelee/ciscospark)
